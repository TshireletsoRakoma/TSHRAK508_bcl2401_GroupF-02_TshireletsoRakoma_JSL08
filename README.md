// The provided code serves several purposes:

// HTML Structure:

// Sets up the basic structure of an HTML document.
// Links to Normalize.css for standardizing default styles across different browsers.
// Links to an external CSS file for additional styling.
// Includes a reference to an external JavaScript file for scripting functionality.

/* CSS Styling: */

/* Resets default styles for the page, such as margins, padding, and background color. */
/* Sets a background image for the body with specific background settings. */
/* Styles the <h1> element with a white background, transparent text, bold font, specific font size, and text alignment. */

// JavaScript Functionality:

// Implements the singleton design pattern using ES6 classes.
// Defines a class named BankBranch to represent a bank branch, ensuring only one instance of the class exists.
// The class constructor initializes the branch information and ensures that only one instance of BankBranch is created.
// Demonstrates the creation of instances of the BankBranch class (branchA and branchB) with different branch information.
// Logs the branch information to the console and checks if branchA and branchB are the same instance.
// Overall, this code sets up a webpage with styled elements and demonstrates the implementation of a singleton design pattern in JavaScript for managing bank branch instances.
